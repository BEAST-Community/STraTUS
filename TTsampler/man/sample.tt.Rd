\title{Sample one or more transmission trees uniformly}
\usage{
sample.tt(generator, count = 1, unsampled = 0, draw = count == 1,
  igraph = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{generator}{A list of class \code{tt.generator} produced by \code{tt.generator}.}

\item{count}{How many transmission trees to sample.}

\item{unsampled}{The number of unsampled hosts in the transmission chain.}

\item{draw}{Use \code{ggtree} to draw a coloured phylogeny showing each transmission tree overlaid onto the phylogeny.}

\item{igraph}{Produce the transmission trees in \code{igraph} format.}
}
\value{
A list, each of whose elements is a list of class \code{tt} with one or more of the following elements:
\itemize{
\item{\code{annotations}}{ Always present. A vector indicating which host (given by numbers corresponding to the ordering in \code{generator$hosts}) is assigned to each phylogeny node.}
\item{\code{edgelist}}{ Always present. A \code{data.frame} giving the edge list; the first column are parents and the second children.}
\item{\code{hidden}}{ Present if \code{unsampled} is greater than 0. The number of "hidden" unsampled hosts (with no associated nodes) along each branch.}
\item{\code{picture}}{ Present if \code{draw} was TRUE; a \code{ggtree} object.}
\item{\code{igraph}}{ Present if \code{igraph} was TRUE; an \code{igraph} object.}
}
